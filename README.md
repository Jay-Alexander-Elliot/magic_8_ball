# magic_8_ball_flutter

## Full Disclosure
This code was adapted from another repo, but it was far too outdated for me to waste time adapting it.
I ended up only using the idea and images from the previous course, everything else is mine.
I'm most likely going to keep on adding changes as an exercise in learning.
